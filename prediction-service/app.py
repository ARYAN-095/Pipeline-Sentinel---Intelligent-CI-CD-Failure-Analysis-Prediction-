# ================== DUMMY MACHINE LEARNING MODEL ==================
# In a real-world scenario, this model would be trained on thousands of
# historical pull requests. For this project, we will create a simple,
# rule-based "dummy" model that is surprisingly effective.

# Let's imagine we have some pre-trained model. We'll simulate this.
# We'll use a simple Logistic Regression model.
# The features (X) would be something like:
# [lines_added, lines_deleted, files_changed]
# The target (y) would be: 0 (success) or 1 (failure)

# Let's create some fake training data to make our model do something.
X_train = pd.DataFrame({
    'lines_added': [10, 100, 500, 20, 800, 1500],
    'files_changed': [2, 5, 20, 3, 25, 40]
})
# 1 = failure, 0 = success
y_train = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1] 

# "Train" our model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
